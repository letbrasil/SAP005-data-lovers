In his youth he was an adventurer of the galaxies, but currently he just wants to live in peace and to use his intelligence to create things for his own benefit.

  "zeepXanflorp" : ["Zeep Xanflorp <br><br> Main characteristics: Intelligence and selfishness <br><br> Zeep has exactly the same profile as Rick Sanchez, the difference is that the scientist of the microverse (universe created by Rick to generate energy for his ship's battery) does not know about the existence of the outside world.

His only purpose is to fulfill the wish of that one who activated the box, so he can finally die. Death is part of his natural cycle and he not only sees it in a positive way, but seeks it ceaselessly. Living for a long time bothers him and what he wants the most is to accomplish his goal as soon as possible.", "./teste-personalidadeRM/img-test/mr-meeseeks.jpg"],
